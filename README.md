# Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions

This project contains a series of challenges focused on higher-order functions in JavaScript/TypeScript. It's designed to help you deepen your understanding of functional programming concepts, specially Higher-Order Functions and Array manipulation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Navigate to the `user/` directory to start solving challenges

```bash
cd user
```

## Project Structure

- **user/**: Write your solutions here. Use the provided function signatures.
- **solutions/**: Reference solutions (try to solve challenges on your own first!)
- **tests/**: Jest tests for validating your solutions

## Running Tests

To run tests for your solutions:

```bash
npm test
```

## Challenges

For a detailed description of each challenge, please see [CHALLENGES.md](./CHALLENGES.md).

1. **addTwo**: Add 2 to any input
2. **addS**: Add "s" to any input string
3. **map**: Implement your own version of the `map` function
4. **forEach**: Implement your own version of `forEach`
5. **mapWith**: Rebuild `map` using `forEach`
6. **reduce**: Implement your own version of `reduce`
7. **intersection**: Find common elements in multiple arrays
8. **union**: Combine unique elements from multiple arrays
9. **objOfMatches**: Build an object based on matching elements
10. **multiMap**: Create a multi-mapped object

## Tips

- Start with the simpler challenges and progress to more complex ones
- Try to solve each challenge before looking at the solution
- Use TypeScript for better type checking and IDE support

## Learning Objectives

By completing these challenges, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:

- Higher-order functions
- Callback functions
- Array manipulation
- Functional programming concepts

Good luck, and happy coding!
